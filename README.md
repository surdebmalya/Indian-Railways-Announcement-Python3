The blueprint of the whole system is like:

```
Through Train Passing Platform Number | Normal Train Train Number(OPTIONAL)
                                     | |
                                      V
                       Train Name Train Category(UP/DOWN)
                                     | |
                                      V
                                  Departing 
                                     | |
                                      V
                            Departing Platform Number
                                     | |
                                      V
                                  Destination
                                     | |
                                      V
                                 Departing Time
                                     | |
                                      V
                                   Arriving 
                                     | |
                                      V
                            Arriving Platform Number
```

I have used two main modules in this project, i.e. tkinter anf gtts, besides of these, I have also used other modules like time,os,sys etc. In this project you can get a clean GUI, which is developed by tkinter, and as a speaking language, I have seleted my mother tongue, Bengali as one of three languages, rest of those are: Hindi and Indian-English.

## My Previous Project On tkinter
I have already worked on tkinter module. I have made a simple calculator with that module, here is the video:
