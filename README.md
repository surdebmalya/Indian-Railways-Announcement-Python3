The blueprint of the whole system is like:
>Through Train
  > Passing Platform Number
> Normal Train
  > Train Number(OPTIONAL)
  > Train Name
  > Train Category(UP/DOWN)
    > Departing
      > Departing Platform Number
      > Destination
      > Departing Time
    > Arriving
      > Arriving Platform Number

I have used two main modules in this project, i.e. tkinter anf gtts, besides of these, I have also used other modules like time,os,sys etc.
In this project you can get a clean GUI, which is developed by tkinter, and as a speaking language, I have seleted my mother tongue, Bengali as one of three languages, rest of those are: Hindi and Indian-English.

I have already worked on tkinter module. I have made a simple calculator with that module, here is the link of the video:
